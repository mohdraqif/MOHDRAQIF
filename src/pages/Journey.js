          <p><span>H</span>TML & CSS. These two brothers for life met me at the commencement of my path. One simple and the other difficult to perceive. There's only one way to understand CSS, experiment it. Bootstrap provided a better design than HTML and did impressive with jQuery besides. That was smooth!</p>

          <p><span>J</span>avascript and libraries. JS never slips to amaze us. With a huge authority over the development network, I must declare that this is my star language in the long run. Be it frontend or backend, JS is all I wanted for the development purpose. Go on and change my mind if JS is not a hero for you.</p>

          <p><span>N</span>odeJS and MongoDB. With NodeJS on your side, the backend is fun. This Javascript engine endures the ultimate power to deal swiftly with the data and databases like MongoDB and others. Hats off to MongoDB Atlas for such an effortless and secure data storage and access services.</p>

Just create an account, connect to GitHub and watch your apps run live! Of course, there are plenty more of the services like Digital Ocean and all.</p>

          <p><span>H</span>ere comes the React. Whatever this stuff is, it's fantastic. I can't tell you enough what not I can do with React in my hand. Really. Again a library of JS powered so high that it can do almost everything. Components for frontend, Contentful for content, Strapi for backend and what else you need?</p>

Ethereum, being the central network of the blockchain was a good skill to earn. I hope to continue with my ongoing Ethereum project with all my energy.</p>
